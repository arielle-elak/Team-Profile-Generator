## Description
The Team Profile Generator makes it easy to create a team using your command line. Simply follow the prompts and a professionally-formatted html page and css will be generated for use on your company website. 

This project is my first implementation of object-oriented programming using Node.js and inquirer. The main challenge was being able to pass multiple parameters through an exported module unscathed. This is also the first time I've implemented user-friendly styling within a console to provide a smooth and uncluttered experience. ASCII and spaces made all that possible.
